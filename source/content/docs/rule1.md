Most lobsters are complete bastards left to their own devices.
Most humans are complete bastards left to their own devices. 
This proves there is a God who wants us to have Order. 
Order is Masculine and Chaos is Feminine.
Therefore to move towards Order, we all need to man up.
Happiness is pointless.
We are all on this Earth to suffer. So learn to suffer like a man.
Not everyone can be as rich and successful as me, but try to be less of a failure than you already are.
